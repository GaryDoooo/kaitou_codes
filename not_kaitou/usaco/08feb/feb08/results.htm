<BODY><PRE>                   FEBRUARY 2008 CONTEST RESULTS

These are the final results of the USACO FEBRUARY 2008 programming
competition.

The next official USACO contest is scheduled for 14-17 March 2008,
the USACO MARCH 2008 programming contest.

Our goal in these contests is to cultivate interest in computer
programming among pre-college students and recognize those who are
outstanding performers.

The elite contest had 688 competitors and 270 observers, a total
of 958 legal entrants, the largest turnout since November of 2006!
No Level One contest was offered.

46 contestants were disqualified for not following the rules; 16
had an unacceptable name (potentially among other infractions).

**********************************************************************

NOTE: Those 47 competitors who read the GOLD or SILVER division
problems and then failed to submit solutions have had their
qualifications removed.

One can always read the problems and solve them on Tuesday in
analysis mode after the regular competition is over.

**********************************************************************

NOTE: Those with invalid email addresses will also lose their
credentials soon.

**********************************************************************

The 958 contestants and observers who successfully submitted at
least one solution came from these 59 countries:

   1 ABW    11 BRA     2 FRA    21 IRN     4 MEX     6 SGP   149 USA

The grading system accepted 8.13 MB of text, a total of 7,991
submissions (perhaps a bit higher than usual because of the output-only
problem).

Here's a summary of how the final graded submissions looked (including
observers):

         Program  Subs    C      Pascal    Java

Java continues to be only a small part of the Gold division.

Mechanically and logistically, the contest ran approximately
perfectly.

The timings for JAVA are reported just as for C (et al.), though
JAVA runs slower, so all JAVA times are actually divided by 2.0.
If your JAVA program ran too slow -- perhaps you're using RandomAccess
input instead of BufferedReader input. The latter can be orders of
magnitude faster!

Test data and analyses are available at http://ace.delos.com/FEB08.htm .

NOTE: New higher speed servers are on the way! Expect faster
compilations. I expect we'll scale CPU reporting in order to match
execution times across upgrade-technologies.

### GOLD Division ######################################################

Greece's Christos Tzamos directed the Gold contest with assistance
and analyses from Richard Peng. Thanks to them for the fine effort.
Be sure to email me if you want to direct a contest!

The problem weightings were determined by the "automatic IOI scoring"
algorithm:

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c
     -----------------------------------------------------
    grading: 260 264.4 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26
      cgame: 340 335.6 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34
      hotel: 396 400.0 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33

Finally, the contest was a bit easier with a mean perhaps 100 points
higher than the previous challenges.  We are doing our best to
create balanced contests and sometimes err a bit on the difficult
side.

Seniors seriously dominated this contest's entries, a reflection
on the growing difficult and elitism of the tasks:

    2012   3 ( 1.8%) *
    2013   1 ( 0.6%)

Five perfect scores in a much better distribution than we've
seen in several months:

Of course, the curve is very much affected by the scoring algorithm
used. Other scoring algorithms push the curve lower.

The best way we know of to improve your score is still the USACO
training pages at http://train.usaco.org .

Congratulations to Romania's strong finishers!  Four of the five
perfect scores were Romanian. Here are the top 11 competitors (all
at or above 850):

     1	2008 ROM Filip Cristian Buru  1000 *** WINNER ***
     1	2008 CHN Qifeng Chen          1000 *** WINNER ***
     1	2010 ROM Cosmin Gheorghe      1000 *** WINNER ***

    10	2009 HRV Goran Zuzic           899
    11	2009 CAN Hanson Wang           861

China's 5 winners were almost matched by Romania's 4, though all
of Romania's big winners achieved a perfect score. Both Hrvatska
(we call it Croatia) and Canada had a winner in this elite set.

A great achievement for all concerned!  Congratulations to all these
fine programmers.

## SILVER Division #####################################################

All the coaches work together to direct the Silver contest with
Richard Peng, as usual, picking up the lion's share of the work.
Thanks to USA competitor Neal Wu, USA alumnus Jeff Wang and Ionescu
Victor for the tasks. Do you have a task idea? Send it to me via
email!

These weights (and the scores below) use the normal USACO scoring
algorithm:

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e
     -----------------------------------------------------------

     egroup:  91 297.0  0  7  9  8  9  9  9 10 10 12  8

While meteor was slightly more challenging, the other tow tasks
were weighted almost equally. This made for a very nice distribution
across the entire spectrum with 13 perfect scores:

Thirteen competitors earned perfect scores. Several with very high
scores took mid-contest promotions and moved to the gold division;
their scores are generally not shown here or in the silver results
below.

         1 2012 CHN Wentai Zhang         1000 *** WINNER ***

The country breakdown includes (besides China) the up-and-coming
players: four from China, four from Georgia, one each from Slovenia,
Singapore, Iran, Canada, and Belarus.

The 30 competitors above 840 points have been promoted to the Gold
division.

Bear in mind that programming contest scores are spread out across
hundreds of points instead of the usual 7 point spread for 93-100%
that so many student achieve in their academic pursuits. Congrats
to these hot scorers in a very difficult contest.

## BRONZE Division #####################################################

Rob Kolstad directed the Bronze contest with problems created by
Jeffrey Wang and Brian Dean.  Thanks to them for their great tasks.

Three problems this time with weightings from low to high. The
scoring and ratings were determined by the standard USACO method.

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c

Juniors dominated again, with just under 1/3 of the total contestants;
ever more youngsters showing up, too:

The scores were distributed mostly through the upper part of the
range with 79 (!!!) perfect scores (many folks moved up to the
Silver division during the contest; their results are not reported
in the Bronze division):

## About the USACO Internet Programming Contests

These contests (the GOLD division in particular) are just incredibly
hard... really amazingly hard -- more so nowadays than even just a
year or two ago.

Winners must master not only algorithmic techniques like dynamic
programming but also the ability to write bug-free code quickly.
This requires practice and skill.  Don't despair if you didn't get
a perfect score this time -- it is hard!

Furthermore, the scoring mechanism is set up so that a huge percentage
of finishers scores in the 0..500 range -- different from many
contests where everyone finishes in the 800..1000 range and the
0..800 range is empty.  If we don't do this, we can't distinguish
among the top competitors.

## Want to Learn More?

Check out the USACO training pages at http://ace.delos.com/usacogate .
They provide practice challenges that can help you move up in the
rankings.

## How USACO Scoring Works

The score results are shown below.  I used a program to determine
how much each problem was worth and how much each test case was
worth.  Basically, it counts how many people got test cases and
problems wrong and uses that to estimate a difficulty and choose a
weight.

Each problem has a certain number of test cases along with a "weight"
that tells how many of the 1,000 points come from that program.
The test cases are also weighted; here is an example:

            points weight 1  2  3  4  5  6
            ------------------------------
      probname: 39 396.6  6  5  6  5  6 11

If you score full marks on cases 1, 2, 3, and 4, you'd have 6+5+6+5=22
out of 39 points for this problem and you receive:

                22/39 * 396.6 = 223.7

total points out of 396.6 possible.  The sum of each problem's
points is your total score.

## Closing (Thanks and Solicitation)

Thanks to the USACO coaches who helped bring this contest together.
Special thinks to our translators.

USACO accepts -- and uses -- problem submissions from anyone!  You
have a real leg up in the contest if we use your problem.  Feel
free to send programming tasks to me.  We now have a staff of 20
coaches and assistant coaches who vet the problems and create
prototype solutions.  This enables us to have many contests throughout
the year with at least some level of predictable quality.
